## Introduction

Neumorphism, also known as neumorphic design, is a visual style that emerged in the world of user interface (UI) design. It focuses on creating a soft, tactile, and realistic user interface by using subtle shadows and highlights to mimic the appearance of physical objects. This website serves as a showcase for neumorphic [Flet](https://flet.dev) design enthusiasts.
